__Binary Package (for running on HBase 1.1.3 or above)__
As there are more and more HBase 1.1 deployments, an binary snapshot build for HBase 1.1.3+ is provided; 
Note the requirement of HBase version 1.1.3 (or above). There is a known bug in HBase earlier versions about fuzzy key filter that will cause
missing rows or lesser aggregations in Kylin query result: [HBASE-14269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14269)
Also, please aware this is not a formal release, and it is not fully tested:

* [apache-kylin-1.3-HBase-1.1-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/kylin/apache-kylin-1.3-snapshot/apache-kylin-1.3-HBase-1.1-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz)

If you're using HBase 1.0, we suggest you to upgrade to 1.1.3+ or downgrade to 0.98/0.99.
